<!-- 
  Temporary workaround: Create icon using canvas and save
  Or download a simple icon and place it as icons/icon.png
  
  For now, we'll make the manifest not require an icon by removing it
-->

To fix the icon issue, you have two options:

OPTION 1: Download a simple icon (EASIEST)
1. Go to: https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/eye (free icons)
2. Download any 128x128 PNG icon
3. Save it to: proctorless-extension/icons/icon.png
4. Done!

OPTION 2: Remove icon requirement (QUICKEST)
1. Edit manifest.json
2. Remove the "icons" section entirely
3. Extension will use default Chrome icon
4. Still fully functional!

OPTION 3: Use a simple placeholder
1. Create a 128x128 pixel image in Paint/Photoshop
2. Save as PNG to: proctorless-extension/icons/icon.png

We recommend OPTION 2 (quickest fix) - the extension works fine without a custom icon.
